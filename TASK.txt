TASK:

Design a CNN model for image classification using Pytorch API. Use MNIST dataset from torchvision.datasets.

Make sure to include the following:
1) Image transforms
2) Data loaders
3) Usage of appropriate Pytorch functions for loading dataset, building the CNN, defining the loss, optimizer, .etc

Also use Matplotlib to visualize the dataset(one selected image and one random image from the dataset.
